## Conclusion

All work in this repository was entirely a group effort and each member of the group was able to commit what they had worked on either individually or as a group. Commits might seem inconsistent, but this is only because physical meet ups were scheduled for most of the development. These meet ups involved [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) from which the end result was mostly code on one individual's computer. However, it was ensured that every member was fully involved and understood how the development came along.
